```

## Pages

- **Home**: Public landing page
- **Login**: Authentication page
- **Dashboard**: Main authenticated user dashboard
- **Profile**: User profile management
- **Settings**: User preferences and settings

## Authentication

The app uses a mock authentication system stored in localStorage. In a real application, this would connect to a backend authentication service.

- **Login**: Provide any email and password to log in
- **Logout**: Clears user data from localStorage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (preferably)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd react-auth-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Testing

The application includes Gherkin format test specifications in the `/tests/features` directory. These can be implemented with testing frameworks like Cucumber.js or Jest with appropriate plugins.

## Notes for Real-World Implementation

This is a demo application with some simulated functionality:

- **Authentication**: Replace the mock auth with a real authentication service 
- **Data**: Connect to a real API for user data
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for a production app
- **Tests**: Implement the provided Gherkin test specifications with a testing framework
